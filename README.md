# **Introduction to Parallel and Distributed Programming**

## **Overview**
This repository contains materials, notes, and practical implementations for the course **"Introduction to Parallel and Distributed Programming"**. The course covers fundamental and advanced topics in parallel and distributed computing, focusing on **data partitioning, parallel computation, communication models, fault tolerance, synchronization, and performance analysis.**

## **Module 1: Introduction (Coming Soon)**
_Updates will be added soon._

### **Lab 1**
For practical exercises related to Module 1, refer to: [Lab 1](https://github.com/sachugowda/pds-bits/blob/main/lab/lab1.md)
